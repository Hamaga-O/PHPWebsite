# Overview
This was a small project created in my class on scripting languages. Primarily consisting of PHP code and HTML, it is a minimal website allowing users to book flights to different locations in Europe. 
It presents a small dropdown with destinations and the airlines with available flights. 
The website integrates MariaDB and using SQL syntax, it creates and updates tables carrying flight pricing and capcities. Additionally, the entered booking information for users and their flights are stored after users are required to enter a valid email address to confirm booking.

## Setup
This website requires your own PHP server to run as processing is carried out server-side. The connection to your SQL database can be configured by changing the variables in login.php
